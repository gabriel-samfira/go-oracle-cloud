// IpNetwork is an ip network that allows you to define an IP subnet in your account.
// The size of the IP subnet and the set IP addresses in the subnet
// are determined by the IP address prefix that you specify while creating
// the IP network. These IP addresses aren't part of the common pool
// of Oracle-provided IP addresses used by the shared network.
// When you add an instance to an IP network, the instance is assigned an
// IP address in that subnet. You can assign IP addresses to instances
// either statically or dynamically, depending on your business needs.
// So you have complete control over the IP addresses assigned to your instances
type IpNetwork struct {

	// Description of the object.
	Description string `json:"description,omitempty"`

	// Specify the size of the IP subnet.
	// It is a range of IPv4 addresses assigned in the
	// virtual network, in CIDR address prefix format.
	// While specifying the IP address prefix take care
	// of the following points:
	//
	// * These IP addresses aren't part of the common
	// pool of Oracle-provided IP addresses used by the shared network.
	//
	// * There's no conflict with the range of IP addresses used in another
	// IP network, the IP addresses used your on-premises network,
	// or with the range of private IP addresses used in the shared network.
	// If IP networks with overlapping IP subnets are linked to an IP exchange,
	// packets going to and from those IP networks are dropped.
	//
	// * The upper limit of the CIDR block size for an IP network is /16.
	//
	// Note: The first IP address of any IP network is reserved for
	// the default gateway, the DHCP server, and the
	// DNS server of that IP network.
	IpAddressPrefix string `json:"ipAddressPrefix"`

	// Specify the IP network exchange to which the IP network belongs.
	// You can add an IP network to only one IP network exchange,
	// but an IP network exchange can include multiple IP networks.
	// An IP network exchange enables access between IP networks that
	// have non-overlapping addresses, so that instances on these
	// networks can exchange packets with each other without NAT.
	IpNetworkExchange string `json:"ipNetworkExchange,omitempty"`

	// Object names can contain only alphanumeric, underscore (_),
	// dash (-), and period (.) characters. Object names are case-sensitive.
	Name string `json:"name"`

	// If true, enable public internet access using NAPT for VNICs without any public IP reservation.
	PublicNaptEnabledFlag bool `json:"publicNaptEnabledFlag"`

	// Tags associated with the object.
	Tags []string `json:"tags,omitempty"`
