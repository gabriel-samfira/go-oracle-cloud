// SecList a security list is a group of one or more instances
// that you can specify as the destination or source
// in a security rule. Instances within a security list
// can communicate fully with one another on all ports.
// When you attach an instance to a security list, the inbound
// and outbound policies defined in the security list are applicable
// to that instance. All instances within a security list can
// communicate fully with one another on all protocols and ports.
// While creating an instance, if you do not attach it to any
// security list, the instance gets attached automatically to
// the predefined /Compute-identity_domain/default/default
// security list, which has the inbound policy set to DENY
// and the outbound policy set to PERMIT.
