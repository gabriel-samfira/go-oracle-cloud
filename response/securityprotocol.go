// SecurityProtocol is a security protocol allows you to specify a transport protocol
// and the source and destination ports to be used with the specified protocol.
// It is used for matching packets in a security rule.
// When you create a security rule, the protocols and ports of the
// specified security protocols are used to determine the type of traffic
// that is permitted by that security rule. If you don't specify protocols
// and ports in a security protocol, traffic is permitted over all protocols and ports.
// You can specify a security protocol in multiple security rules.
// So if you have a protocol that you want to use in a number of
// security rules, you don't have to create the protocol multiple times.
